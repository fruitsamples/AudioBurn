AudioBurn demonstrates some of the features of DRTracks.  It shows how to create an object conforming to the DRTrackProduction protocol and track properties to create a RedBook audio CD from AIFF files.

NOTE: AudioBurn will not recognize compressed (AIFF-C) files, even those with no compression.

The sample also uses the DiscRecordingUI framework to present the standard burn setup and progress user interfaces.
